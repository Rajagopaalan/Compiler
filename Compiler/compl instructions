/*
 * Write your code in a SEPARATE FILE, do NOT edit this file.
 *
 *
 * If using C, include lexer.h in your code and compile and
 * link your code like this:
 *
 * $ gcc -Wall lexer.c your_file.c
 *
 *
 *
 * If using C++, include lexer.h like this in your code:
 *
 * extern "C" {
 *     #include "lexer.h"
 * }
 *
 * And compile and link your code like this:
 *
 * $ gcc -Wall -c lexer.c
 * $ g++ -Wall lexer.o your_file.cpp
 *
 * The first command just compiles the C code. The second
 * command compiles your C++ code and links it with the
 * compiled lexer.
